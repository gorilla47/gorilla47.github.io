## Introduction
I started at my higher learning journey at SNHU in January of 2018 getting a degree in computer science. Throughout my time at SNHU I have learned a lot of different skills varying from data structures and algorithms to studying topics through different lens to get a better perspective. I have had experience in many programming languages which include python, C++, C#, Java, C, binary, SQL, and assemble. While the program didn’t go far in depth in any of these languages it has given me a solid foundation for studying further and giving me direction in what I want as a career. Since the computer science field includes so many different pathways, I have done research and decided I would like to do software development or robotics. If I got a career in one, I would take the other one up as a hobby.
	
 In the computer science programs there were a lot of the skills I have learned, one that I think that will be most useful in my career is collaborative coding. In one of the classes we learned how to use Git and how to use pull, push, and merges to work with the whole class on one project. Another useful skill is object-oriented programming (OOP), which I first learned early in the CS program and it was built on as the program progressed. During the final terms we got into advanced concepts of OOP and used UML to create a plan on a software development project. 
 
## Artifact Introduction
The artifact I choose to enhance comes from CS-250’s final project where we had to create an application for a travel agent company. This application is a slide show that would show the top five travel destinations. Below I will explain how I will use this artifact to show my skills within three categories, software design/engineering, databases, and algorithms and data structures. 
	
### Software Design/Engineering
To accomplish the goal of this category I am going to expand the complexity of the artifact and refine it using object-oriented best practices and rewrite the program from Java to C#. Instead of just a slide show to browse through the top five destinations my goal is to implement features that allow the user to book the vacation package. As shown below in the pseudocode I am going to add a button that allows this to happen and walk the user through booking the package, also implement the user logging in or signing up within the system. By implementing these enhancements, I am showing that I have the knowledge of how to create an object-oriented system and how to apply best coding practices.

### Databases
To accomplish this task, I am going to be creating a SQL database to store the information of the vacation packages and user information. Originally the project had the information stored within strings of the program, so adding additional packages required an edit of the source code this limited scalability of the program. As shown in the pseudocode below I am going to use the application to send an SQL query to the database and have it store and display the returned information. This will show the skills of how to create, maintain and interact with a database.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
	For this category I have decided to implement a key word function to search through all the vacation packages. The application originally used a slide show to present the vacations destination to the user. This limits scalability of the application, if there were a great number of destinations the user would have to click through all of them with no way to sort or limit the number. As seen in the pseudocode below I am going to have the user select what they want to search by (destination, price, climate, etc.…), then the application will search the database and find what kinds of vacations match the search and return them to the user. This enhancement will show case my skills of being able to implement an algorithm that efficiently searches through data and returns the data to the user. The algorithm will have to be scalable while also being resource efficient. 
  
### Skill Summary
Through these enhancements I will demonstrate several skills learned through my time in the Computer Science program. I will show that I know how to make an application that follows the industries best coding practices through object-oriented design. I will demonstrate the knowledge on how to solve complicated problems through logic and computer software. Through the code review I will show that I know industry standard formatting, style, naming conventions, proper test coverage, and finding security flaws within code.
